# Multi-Task Robotic Design Project | Webots Simulation

This repository contains the Webots simulation files for a multi-task robotic system capable of performing advanced tasks such as line following, maze solving, wall following, chess manipulation, and bridge construction.

## Features

### Advanced Line Following
Tracks continuous, dotted, and segmented lines with high precision.

### Color Detection
Identifies and reacts to specific colors as part of task execution.

### Maze Solving
Utilizes optimized algorithms to navigate mazes effectively.

### Segmented Wall Following
Tracks and follows segmented walls in confined environments.

### Chess Piece Manipulation
Picks up and places chess pieces accurately.

### Bridge Construction
Simulates building a bridge for traversing obstacles.
